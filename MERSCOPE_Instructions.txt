~~About detected transcripts file~~
These .csv files (detected_transcripts.csv) contain the list of all detected transcripts in the sample where each row is a detected transcript. 
The column names and descriptions of what the column represents are:
	A. barcode_id - internally used id of the gene. Each gene has a unique barcode_id
	B. global_x, global_y - The global micron x and y coordinates of this transcript
	C. x, y - The pixel coordinates of this transcript within the field of view
	D. global_z - The index of the z slice that this transcript was detected in. Each z slice is separated by 1.5 microns
	E. fov - the index of the field of view where this transcript was detected
	F. gene - the gene name of this detected transcript
	
NOTE: global coordinates are micron! This needs to be pixels

1. Preprocessing
	- make new columns in detected_transcripts that have global pixel coordinates
