"Cluster_Markers.csv" are the original clustering results that rely on Yasin's interpretation of cluster markers. These are the most detailed annotations
	- the annotations (.obs) are stored in "03-clustering/adata_obs.pk"
	- the object with original clusters is "03-clustering/baysor_seg.h5ad"
	
Later annotations use more coarse-grain resolution, and subcluster macrophages.
